# edd-wave

Connects Easy Digital Downloads to Wave Apps. If you are accepting Stripe payments using EDD's Stripe extension or PayPal Payments using EDD's PayPal Commerce Pro, this EDD extension will move bookkeeping data into your Wave Apps transactions using Wave's GraphQL API. It saves a ton of data-entry, and picks up where free Zapier leaves off.

The plugin has a settings panel where you can map your downloads and accounts to Wave accounts (in Chart of Accounts). Tax and fee coverage is minimal so far, so if you'd like to see this developed, get in touch or make a pull request.
